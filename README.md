Furniro - E-Commerce Landing Page
A premium, high-fidelity interior design storefront built to demonstrate modern web layout techniques.

Current Progress: Successfully completed the UI/UX phase, focusing on a pixel-perfect recreation of the Furniro design.

Key Components: Features a responsive navigation bar, high-impact hero section, curated product grids, and a staggered CSS gallery.

Technologies Used: Built with Semantic HTML5 for SEO and CSS Grid/Flexbox for a fully responsive, mobile-first experience.

Performance: Optimized for speed by using clean, "Vanilla" code without heavy external libraries or frameworks.

Next Steps: Currently integrating Vanilla JavaScript to power the shopping cart logic and dynamic product rendering.
